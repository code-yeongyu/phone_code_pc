'Phone Code-PC' is an Android Application that lets you write codes with more instinctive experiences.
We have seen a lot of Programming Applications that based on Text Editor which doesn't provide instinctive experiences.
You have to use lots of symbols when you write your code. It is an effective way on your Computer with your keyboard.
In Android Devices, it makes programmer uncomfortable while writing codes.

We spend lots of times outside.
I am a student who gets on buses and trains a lot.
Writing codes while these places is a nuisance.
That is the reason why I started to make 'Phone Code-PC'.

# How does it provide instinctive experiences?

Use this method of coding will provide you better experiences with fewer symbols.
'Phone Code-PC' is not just an application for practicing programming, unlike any other devices.
