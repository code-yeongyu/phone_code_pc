# What is 'Phone Code-PC'?
'Phone Code-PC' is an Android Application that lets you write codes with more instinctive experiences.<br/>
We have seen a lot of Programming Applications that based on Text Editor which doesn't provide instinctive experiences.<br/>
You have to use lots of symbols when you write your code. It is an effective way on your Computer with your keyboard.<br/>
In Android Devices, it makes programmer uncomfortable while writing codes.<br/>

# Who thought to write a code with Android Devices? It seems a bad idea.
We spend lots of times outside.<br/>
Writing codes while these places is a nuisance.<br/>
That is the reason why I started to make 'Phone Code-PC'.<br/>

# How does it provide instinctive experiences?
Most of you guys have seen tools like Scratch, Entry, and App Inventer which makes you to code with stacking blocks.<br/>
Use this method of coding will provide you better experiences with fewer symbols.<br/>
'Phone Code-PC' is not just an application for practicing programming, unlike any other devices.<br/>
'Phone Code-PC' is a real tool that makes you write codes for your projects.<br/>
